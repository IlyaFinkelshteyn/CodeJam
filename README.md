## CodeJam
CodeJam is a set of handy reusable .NET components that can simplify your daily work and
save your time when you copy and paste your favorite helper methods and classes from one project to another.

The CodeJam project includes two parts:

* Main - stable and feature complete code.
* Experimental - A workspace for code development. Contains incomplete and/or unstable parts.

### Main
CodeJam is dedicated to one principal goal: creating and maintaining reusable code. The CodeJam.Main is a place for
collaboration and sharing, where developers community can work together on code to be shared by the CodeJam.

CodeJam developers will make an effort to ensure that their components have no dependencies on other third-party
libraries, so that these components can be deployed easily. In addition, CodeJam will keep their interfaces as stable as
possible, so that users can use it without having to worry about changes in the future.

We welcome participation from all who are interested, at all skill levels. Coding, documenting, testing and
development process itself are all critical parts of the software development process. If you are interested in
contribute in any of these aspects, please join us!
