## What is it? (short version)

CodeJam.PerfTests is performance testing framework for .Net projects.

It allows to compare multiple implementations by execution time (*~memory limits coming soon~*), to annotate test methods with timing limits and to check the limits each time the test is run.

As you may have mention, I'm not native English speaker and docs sometimes are... weird. If you dislike the texts as much as I do and you want to improve them - you're welcome!

All documentation files are [here](https://github.com/rsdn/CodeJam/tree/master/PerfTests/docs). Feel free to do PR or just [create an issue](https://github.com/rsdn/CodeJam/issues) (to notify you're fixing the document), download, edit and attach fixed file(s) into issue.

* [AppVeyor CI](https://www.appveyor.com) and personal to [@FeodorFitsner](https://github.com/FeodorFitsner). It just works and when it is not there's best CI support we have tried so far.
* [NUnit project](https://www.nunit.org/) and especially to [@CharliePoole](https://github.com/CharliePoole). Almost perfect.
* RSDN.org members [@Буравчик](http://rsdn.org/account/info/58047) & [@Lexey](http://rsdn.org/account/info/460): [lognormal distribution for relative timings proposal](http://rsdn.org/forum/alg/6471574) (RUS). (Notify me if I should use another links to your profiles!)
